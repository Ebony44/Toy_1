The original motivation is a geometric one: The dot product can be used for computing the angle α
between two vectors a and b

:

a⋅b=|a|⋅|b|⋅cos(α)

a⋅b = AxBx+AyBy


cos(α) = a⋅b / |a|⋅|b|

(α) = arccosine(a⋅b / |a|⋅|b|)
float angle = Mathf.Acos(dotProduct / (vector1.magnitude * vector2.magnitude));

float angle = Mathf.Rad2Deg * (Mathf.Atan2(pointB.y - pointA.y, pointB.x - pointA.x));

Thanks a lot. Now all points works as charm. I just had to add following correction “-(90 - angle)”

.

Note the sign of this expression depends only on the angle's cosine, therefore the dot product is

<0 if the angle is obtuse,
>0 if the angle is acute,
=0 if the a and b are orthogonal.

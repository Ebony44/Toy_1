The original motivation is a geometric one: The dot product can be used for computing the angle α
between two vectors a and b

:

a⋅b=|a|⋅|b|⋅cos(α)

a⋅b = AxBx+AyBy


cos(α) = a⋅b / |a|⋅|b|




.

Note the sign of this expression depends only on the angle's cosine, therefore the dot product is

<0 if the angle is obtuse,
>0 if the angle is acute,
=0 if the a and b are orthogonal.
